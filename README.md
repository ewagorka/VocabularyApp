# VocabularyApp
As a part of my Mobile Development with Android module, I have created an Android Application, that allows the user
to learn a new language by creating their own word list. To do so, the users have to firstly add words (in their native language 
and in the language their learning). Those can be later reviewed. The words would be stored in a persistent database. If the user 
changes their preference over the language their learning, they can do that in the corresponding section of the app. This action will 
cause deleting all the previously added words.

Here I have only Included my kotlin scripts. To see full documentation and screenshots of the working 
app you can click here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q5hrSZb45ID5ga5GkghxJWRmHbWv35V4/view?usp=sharing
